# INTRODUCTION

**Final Project**

Airline companiesâ€™ database

An airline company wants an information system to control the allocation of its
personnel to planes and their flights.

**Step 1 Goals**

1. Draw the conceptual diagram that models the universe of shape speech
   minimalist as possible, specifying in text form the restrictions of integrity
   that could not be supported graphically. You must use the entity-association
   model notation.

2. Build the relational schema corresponding to the conceptual diagram using
   SQL DDL commands, trying to cover as many integrity constraints as possible.
   possible, and identifying those that could not be supported. To present SQL
   DML commands to insert sample data into all schema tables relational.

**Step 2 Goals**
Translate the following data requests into SQL/DML queries:

1. Captains who performed flights to Paris between 10/31/2015 and 11/30/2015.

2. Total number of flights performed by each aircraft since the beginning of
   this year.

3. Flights in which commander Abel Antunes and co-pilot Carlos Caldas flew
   together.

4. Captains (full name, license number and date of issue of the license)
   authorized to flying planes with a range of more than 500km. The result is
   intended to be sorted alphabetically, by first name and surname,
   respectively.

5. Pilots who have never flown on route 12345.

6. Airplanes that have already flown on all the company's routes.

7. Name and number of flight hours of the co-pilots who made the greatest number
   of flights. It is intended to know the exact number of flights made by each
   of these co-pilots.

8. Flights that allow travel from Lisbon to Paris. Note that they must be
   considered also flights containing stopovers in these two cities. Based on
   the inserts provided in the insertE2.sql file, translate to a request for
   textual data and an SQL/DML query.
